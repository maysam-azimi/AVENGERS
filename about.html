	<h1>ABOUT</h1>
	<p>the before i die project Created by the artist Candy Chang, Before I Die is a global art project that invites
		people to contemplate mortality and share their personal aspirations in public. </p>



	<p>In these days of distraction and polarization, the Before I Die project offers a modern ritual that restores
		perspective and invites people to consider the things which connect them.
	</p>

	<p>
		thanks to the thousands of people who have created walls in their communities, Before I Die has become a global
		participatory public art project that reimagines our relationship with death and with one another. The original wall
		was created on an abandoned house in New Orleans by artist Candy Chang after the death of someone she loved. Since
		then, over four thousand Before I Die walls have been created in seventy-eight countries around the world. Each wall
		is created by local residents who want to make a space in their community to restore perspective and share more with
		one another. Each wall is a tribute to living an examined life.</p>
